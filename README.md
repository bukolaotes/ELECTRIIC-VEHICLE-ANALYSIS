# Project Title: Electric Vehicles Data Analysis

## Objective

The aim of this project is to explore patterns, trends and relationship within the data to understand key aspects of the Electric Value Market Which include understanding EV adoption, Evaluating Markets Factors, Geographic and Demographic Analysis and Policy Impact. Which cover from year 2011 till 2024.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset I will be working with includes the following columns:

•	Identification: A truncated version of Vehicle Identification Number, which uniquely identifies each Vehicle
•	Make and Model: Highlights the manufacturer (e.g., Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan) and specific vehicle model (e.g., Tesla Model 3). Allows identification of popular brands and models dominating EV market.
•	Electric Vehicle Type: indicates whether a vehicle is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
•	Electric Range: specifies the maximum distance a vehicle can travel on a full charge (in miles). critical for analyzing consumer preferences and market readiness for longer range EVs.
•	BASE MSRP: Manufacturer’s suggested retail price in dollars.
•	Country, City, State, and Postal Code: provides details about the vehicle’s registration location allowing for regional analysis of EV adoption.
•	Vehicle Location (Latitude/Longitude): geographic coordinates for mapping Ev density and infrastructure development

•	Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Indicates whether a vehicle qualifies as a clean alternative fuel vehicle which may impact its marketability and adoption rates.
•	Electric Utility: Lists the utility company serving the vehicle’s registration area. Useful for understanding the infrastructure supporting EV Charging.
•	Model year: Reflects the year the vehicle was manufactured. Helps to track adoption trends and technological advancements over time.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1.	Total Vehicles:
•	Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market size and growth.

2.	 Average Electric Range:
•	Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

3.	Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:

•	Identify and analyze the total number of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

4.	Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
•	Identify and analyze the total number of plug-in hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share plug in hybrid models.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
•	 There was no Duplicates in the dataset
•	No blanks in the dataset
