# Project Title: Electric Vehicles Data Analysis

## Objective

The aim of this project is to explore patterns, trends and relationship within the data to understand key aspects of the Electric Value Market Which include understanding EV adoption, Evaluating Markets Factors, Geographic and Demographic Analysis and Policy Impact. Which cover from year 2011 till 2024.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset I will be working with includes the following columns:

•	Identification: A truncated version of Vehicle Identification Number, which uniquely identifies each Vehicle

•	Make and Model: Highlights the manufacturer (e.g., Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan) and specific vehicle model (e.g., Tesla Model 3). Allows identification of popular brands and models dominating EV market.

•	Electric Vehicle Type: indicates whether a vehicle is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).

•	Electric Range: specifies the maximum distance a vehicle can travel on a full charge (in miles). critical for analyzing consumer preferences and market readiness for longer range EVs.

•	BASE MSRP: Manufacturer’s suggested retail price in dollars.

•	Country, City, State, and Postal Code: provides details about the vehicle’s registration location allowing for regional analysis of EV adoption.

•	Vehicle Location (Latitude/Longitude): geographic coordinates for mapping Ev density and infrastructure development

•	Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Indicates whether a vehicle qualifies as a clean alternative fuel vehicle which may impact its marketability and adoption rates.

•	Electric Utility: Lists the utility company serving the vehicle’s registration area. Useful for understanding the infrastructure supporting EV Charging.

•	Model year: Reflects the year the vehicle was manufactured. Helps to track adoption trends and technological advancements over time.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1.	Total Vehicles:
   
•	Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market size and growth.

2.	 Average Electric Range:
   
•	Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

3.	Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:

•	Identify and analyze the total number of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.

•	Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

4.	Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
   
•	Identify and analyze the total number of plug-in hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.

•	Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share plug in hybrid models.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
•	 There were no Duplicates in the dataset

•	No blanks in the dataset

## Tools Used:
•	Microsoft Excel

•	Tableau

## Findings

1. EV Type Distribution
   
•	Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):77.6%

•	Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):22.4%

BEVS dominate, reflecting a preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrids
registered.

2. Top Brands and Models
- Market share by Brands:
- Tesla leads with 45.8% of registrations, followed by Nissan (8.9%) and Chevrolet (7.9%).
  
- Other notable brands include Ford, BMW, and Kia.

3. Adoption Trends (Year-on-Year Growth)
   
	Key Years of growth:

   - In year 2011 there was massive growth of 3216.6% which may be due to policy incentives or new EV launches.
 
   - From year 2018 till 2022 there was consistent growth in adoption,peaking in 2021 with a 65.4% increase.
     
   - There was decline in 2024 due to limited data or new market dynamics.
   
  
4.Geographical Analysis
   
•	 Top 5 States

o Washington (150,082 vehicles) leads by wide margin, followed by California (92 registered electric vehicles), Maryland (33 registered electric vehicles), Texas (20 registered electric vehicles) and North Carolina (13 registered electric vehicles).

•	Bottom 5 States

o	Georgia has only (5 registered electric vehicles), Missouri (4 vehicles), Nebraska, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky and Massachusetts have only (3 registered electric vehicles) each, Wyoming, Idaho, Kansas, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas and Utah have only (2 registered electric vehicle) each, Montana, Minnesota and Mississippi have only (1 registered electric vehicle each.


5.CAFV Eligibility
•	62,887 are cafv eligible vehicles

•	17,829 are cafv non eligible vehicles

•	69,697 are cafv unknown.


## Recommendations
1.	Expansion of charging infrastructure and incentives in rural areas to encourage broader Electric vehicle adoption. Cities can be used as pilot regions for large scale Electric vehicle adoption, but rural areas should not be overlooked, as they are essential for nationwide adoption.
2.	The manufacturers of Electric vehicle should prioritize BEV (battery electric vehicle) production and innovation, particularly focusing on increasing range and reducing costs. Offering incentives for BEVs, such as tax credits or rebates, can stimulate further growth.
3.	The government should continue to provide incentives and subsidies to encourage the purchase of CAFV-eligible vehicles. Expanding eligibility criteria and focusing on long range, affordable vehicles can lead to broader adoption
4.	Continued support for EV adoption through federal and state policies is crucial. Manufacturers of electric vehicles can take advantage of this upward trend by introducing new models or by expanding EV infrastructure to meet growing demand.
5.	Manufacturer of electric vehicles and their sales teams should target high adoption regions for marketing campaigns and dealership expansion. They should also consider local government partnerships to leverage state specific incentives.
6.	Analyses of success factors behind leading models like tesla model Y(28,501) should be done by manufacturers of  EV to  inform future vehicle development. Identifying key features that drive demand such as design, range, and pricing, will help improve market fit.
7.	Collaboration between automakers and utility providers can optimize charging infrastructure rollout. Utilities should focus on enhancing their services to meet the growing demand for EV charging stations particularly in high -density urban areas and new EV hotspots.
